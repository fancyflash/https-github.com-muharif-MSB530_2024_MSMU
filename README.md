#### Own RStudio

Follow this [this link](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup/git-with-rstudio/)

### REMEMBER!!! Always update the GitHub data in the RStudio to make sure that you have the latest files.

1. Click on the GIT logo
2. Click on "Pull Branches"

!!!! Never click on the "Push Branches" (I've disabled the merging capability, but try to avoid it still :D)
